# CaptionGenerator
The generator gives captions for images.The generator is built using a LSTM model ,with vgg16 cnn used for extracting image features and NLP techniques for text pre processing and caption data from fliker8k dataset .
Change the BASE_DIR and WORKING_DIR to your local address and preferably run the file on a juypter notebook .
NOTE: this project might need more compute power and for the first time feature extraction and processing it will take 8 hours or less depending on your hardware specifications.
